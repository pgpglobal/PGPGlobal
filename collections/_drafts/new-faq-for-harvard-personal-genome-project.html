<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>Our FAQ link on the Harvard Personal Genome Project website has been broken for a while now, which hasn't helped us keep up with incoming support emails. We're happy to announce that as of today, the <a href="https://github.com/PGPHarvard/FAQ/wiki/FAQ">new FAQ is available</a>. It may also be found by going to <a href="https://my.pgp-hms.org/">my.pgp-hms.org</a> &gt; About &gt; FAQ.</p>
<p>We hope this FAQ helps answer some of your questions.</p>
