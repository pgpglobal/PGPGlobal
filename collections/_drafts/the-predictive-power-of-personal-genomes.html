<p>A recent study, <a href="http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/early/2012/04/02/scitranslmed.3003380">"The Predictive Capacity of Personal Genome Sequencing"</a>, was recently published online at <a href="http://stm.sciencemag.org/">Science Translational Medicine</a>. The study appeared to criticize the utility of personal genomes for health care, stating:<em> "our results suggest that genetic testing, at its best, will not be the dominant determinant of patient care."</em></p>
<p>The study has provoked a large amount of reaction, including a New York Times article (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/03/health/research/dnas-power-to-predict-is-limited-study-finds.html">"Study Says DNA’s Power to Predict Illness Is Limited"</a>) apparently treating the publication as a surprising and unhappy result. Geneticists were baffled, frustrated, and critical -- that genetics is not determinism is not a new finding. If environment didn't matter, why should we worry about lifestyle choices like exercise and diet? <a href="http://blogs.nature.com/news/2012/04/questioning-value-personal-genomics.html">Criticisms abounded.</a></p>
<p>So what follows here are some of my own thoughts on the matter.</p>
<p><strong>The study's technique: Identical twins as a model for the influence of genetics</strong></p>
<p>A major difficulty in understanding the full usefulness of genome data is that we don't know enough yet. We're still searching for answers to the causes of rare and common diseases. This problem has been called <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2008/081105/full/456018a.html">the problem of "missing heritability"</a>. (Others argue that it isn't there in the first place -- that we've overestimated how heritable things were in the first place.)</p>
<p>This study took an interesting tactic to address the issue -- they used identical twins as a model for heritability. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_study">Twin studies</a> have a well-established history in genetics -- because they share identical genomes, when identical twins share the same disease more often (especially when compared to fraternal twins) it helps demonstrate a genetic component for the disease. By using twins as a model, the authors didn't need to know exactly what genetic variants were causing any disease. Of course, twin studies also suffer from serious criticisms. Because twins share an environment from the moment of conception, their medical histories will conflate genetics and environment. But because the paper explicitly sets out to explore the <em>maximum possible</em> predictive power, I don't think the overestimation of genetic effects from twins is necessarily a flaw.</p>
<p>There has also been criticism that the mathematical models are divorced from reality.<a href="http://blogs.nature.com/news/2012/04/questioning-value-personal-genomics.html"> Erika Check Hayden's write-up</a> on this story quoted <a href="http://www.genetic-inference.co.uk/blog/">Luke Jostins</a> as saying, <em>"The particular parameters in the model don’t really correspond to anything in terms of real world behaviour of genetic risk variants. This divorces the model from population-genetic plausibility, making the results potentially meaningless."</em> I don't have much to say about this myself, as I haven't spent time examining this mathematical model or understanding other models for genetic risk in populations.</p>
<p><strong>24 disease</strong>s</p>
<p>What I can say is that the study had to pick a list of diseases to study, and one might find reason to question their particular choices. They justify the choices of 24 diseases as representing "diverse etiologies" (i.e. diverse aspects of human health). Most of their choices are diseases which weren't really thought to be particularly genetic in the first place. (In fact this might be why the twin study data was available in the first place -- researchers were searching for exciting, undiscovered genetic correlations to report.)</p>
<p>Particularly questionable, I think, was the inclusion of "symptom-based diagnoses" which are probably conflating diverse underlying causes, including: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urinary_incontinence">urinary incontinence</a>, general <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystocia">dystocia</a> (a.k.a. difficult childbirth, often requiring cesaerean section), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritable_bowel_syndrome">irritable bowel syndrome</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_fatigue_syndrome">chronic fatigue syndrome</a>. That last one has some particularly weirdness: chronic fatigue syndrome is a controversial diagnosis in itself, and Table 1 reports the twin cohort used had 22% of females affected. 22%! Even the <em>highest</em> prevalence estimates given by Wikipedia put chronic fatigue syndrome at 3% of the population. Pulling out <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16168155">the source (Sullivan et al.)</a> they used, I find that the "22%" refers only to females reporting "fatigue" -- <em>not</em> "chronic fatigue", not every "prolonged fatigue".[1] I didn't spend much time digging into this, so to find such an inaccuracy is certainly a troubling result.[2]</p>
<p><strong>The long tail of disease</strong></p>
<p>Whatever you think the best 24 diseases would have been, there's a long tail to disease. While it's true that we all worry about common diseases, many of us also have some personal experience of diseases that are uncommon or rare. While individually the chances you have experienced any particular rare disease is extremely small, the chances you or a relative experiences <em>any</em> rare disease is much higher.[3] This report estimates, in total, 2-3% of individuals have some form of rare disease -- when you include your first and second degree relatives (siblings, parents, grandparents, &amp; aunts/uncles), the chances of someone in your family having a rare disease is closer to 20-30%.[4]</p>
<p>These things add up. Genetic variations with a significant impact on disease are generally rare -- because they tend to be selected against evolutionarily. And yes, it's true, that means the chance of having any one of them is quite small. But when you add all the rare and uncommon diseases together, you'll get something pretty significant. No matter what 24 diseases you pick, you'll have trouble accounting for the full impact of personal genomes -- especially if that impact is found in the long and rare end of that tail.</p>
<p><strong>Standard medical screening isn't predictive for most people</strong></p>
<p>Finally, one of the most frustrating aspects I'm finding in this criticism of personal genomes (as published by the New York Times) is the idea that personal genomes fails because it "will [not], for the most part, predict a person’s medical future".</p>
<p>Since when is predicting the future for "most people" a criterion for medical testing? Most infants will not have a metabolic disorder, most women will not develop breast cancer, most people will not develop colon cancer. And yet screening for these things is standard medical practice -- indeed, for the first, we would find it abhorrent to neglect newborn screening because "it doesn't predict anything for most newborns"! While I think it's still possible for genomes (especially when combined with other information about environment and history) to be useful for "most people", not achieving such universality is hardly a failure. To say that genomes must meet such an extraordinary standard of utility to be considered medically useful -- and otherwise view them as a disappointment -- is a frustrating and irrational form of genetic exceptionalism.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>[1] Why do this? Perhaps the choice of the broadest "fatigue" category from Sullivan et al. was based on Sullivan et al.'s own observation of "stronger correlations" for male monozygotic twin diagnoses in the least extreme categories ("fatigue" rather than more stringent "chronic fatigue" categories). I don't see a claim of statistical significance for these "stronger correlations", it wasn't true for females ... and ... I'm suspicious of reading too much into any study which slices date a dozen different ways. There's just too much potential for implicit and unconscious multiple hypothesis testing. At any rate, it was absolutely incorrect to quote their data for "fatigue" as representing "chronic fatigue syndrome".</p>
<p>[2] <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/446631/">"Bugs are like mushrooms - found one, look around for more..."</a> ... painfully true, and not just of programming.</p>
<p>[3] In my own family I have second degree relatives with mental retardation (<a href="blog.personalgenomes.org/2012/02/08/its-a-boy-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-direct-to-consumer-genomics/">as mentioned in a previous post</a>) and kidney disease, both believed to be genetic in origin (but with an unknown cause). My husband has enough features of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marfan_syndrome">Marfan Syndrome</a> to get his aorta &amp; genes checked -- he looks fine (almost certainly just some "Marfanoid features").</p>
<p>[4] My assumption for this number is that individuals have, on average, 10-12 first &amp; second degree relatives. Obviously the minimum is 6 (two parents, four grandparents); I think the actual average number is probably significantly higher than 10-12.</p>
