<p>“What, if anything, has happened to the samples I mailed?”</p>
<p>“You’re collecting saliva samples?  Really?  How do I get on that list?”</p>
<p>“I’m sure I saw feature X once, but now I can’t find it.”</p>
<p>One feature request we heard several different ways at GET2012 was: make it easier to find stuff at my.personalgenomes.org.  Especially: “What are my participation opportunities right now?”</p>
<p>This week we have made two simple improvements which we hope will make a big difference.</p>
<p>First, the participant “home page” is no longer just a list of links to other parts of the site.  It now shows personalized and current information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Highlighted “next steps” like studies and tissue collections you can sign up for;</li>
<li>Data points about how complete and current your profile is, like how many family relations you’ve established within the PGP, and when you last updated your PHR data;</li>
<li>Reminders, when needed, to add or update contact information and designated proxies;</li>
<li>Tracking information about specimens you have contributed, and analysis data derived from them;</li>
<li>Links to some recent blog posts here at <a href="http://blog.personalgenomes.org/">blog.personalgenomes.org</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also added a <a href="https://my.personalgenomes.org/pages/sitemap">site map</a>.  If you’re looking for something in particular, or if you want an overview of the site, this should help.</p>
<p>As astute participants might have guessed from the above mention of “analysis data”, we have also been deploying features to allow participants to preview specimen analysis data (like whole genome sequences) prior to publication, and we expect to start putting those features to work very very soon!</p>
