<p>For many of you this notice is a repeat – we've <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1sDm0Tg7KzEHCgesgMtMTwVLp8Jrj8MMXVJMvOQZOXus/viewform">opened up our application for Harvard PGP participants to attend GET Labs</a>! This year <a href="http://www.getconference.org/GET2014/labs.html">GET Labs</a> will be its own event on April 29th, at the IBM Innovation Center in Cambridge, MA. (The GET conference is the following day, and will have separate tickets.) We have <a href="http://www.getconference.org/GET2014/labs.html">over a dozen labs already signed up</a> to work with participants – and planning to return resulting research data! Participants will also be welcome to organize their own sessions and gatherings.</p>
<p>Space is limited and to ensure that our researchers find GET Labs a valuable experience, we've limited our invitations to Harvard PGP participants that have shared significant genetic data on their public profile (genome, exome, or genome-scale genotyping like 23andme or Family Tree DNA) and have completed the current set of surveys.</p>
<p>If you're not a participant but have genome-scale data you want to share publicly from 23andme or Family Tree DNA, you can <a href="https://my.pgp-hms.org/signup">enroll now in the Harvard PGP</a> – we'll accept new enrollees as GET Labs participants, provided they have this data shared publicly.</p>
