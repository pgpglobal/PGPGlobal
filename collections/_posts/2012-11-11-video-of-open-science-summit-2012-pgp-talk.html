<p>I've uploaded a video of the talk I gave at the 2012 <a href="http://opensciencesummit.com/">Open Science Summit</a>. The talk itself is only twelve minutes long -- it's a fairly fast-paced overview of the <a href="http://www.personalgenomes.org/">Personal Genome Project</a>'s motivations and goals, with updates on recent progress.</p>
