<p>Tomorrow we are bringing together over 100 Harvard Personal Genome Project participants and 20 research groups who wish to collaborate with them and make some science together!  We're thrilled that the New York Times is featuring a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/29/science/from-volunteers-a-dna-database.html">profile</a> of the event and its attendees (i.e. "omic astronauts") in tomorrow's print edition.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/29/science/from-volunteers-a-dna-database.html">Check it out</a>!</p>
<p>This is the fifth year that the nonprofit PersonalGenomes.org has organized the <a href="www.getconference.org">GET Conference</a>, and it is going to be the best year yet.  One really exciting aspect is <a href="http://www.getconference.org/GET2014/labs.html">GET Labs</a>, which we made into a standalone event the day before the regular conference. The focus is on *doing* science, not talking about it. We bring together a cohort of extremely well-characterized and well-consented individuals enrolled in the Harvard Personal Genome Project &amp; researchers who wish to study them. Around 20 research groups signed-up to attend this year, and will be performing a wide range of activities from armpit microbiomes to adult stem cell establishment.  Everyone gets a<a href="http://blog.personalgenomes.org/2014/04/24/get-labs-passports/"> little passport</a> for documenting their adventures in health research.</p>
