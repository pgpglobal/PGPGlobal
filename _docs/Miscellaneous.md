## Assets

Using CSS, JS, images and other assets is straightforward with Jekyll. Place them in your root site folder and they’ll copy across to the built site. The default location for them is in the `assets` directory, but you can put them anywhere that doesn't have a `_` in front of it.

Currently the Assets structure looks like this:

assets/
├── fonts
└── images

## Link Structures

<li><a class="post-link" href="{{ author.url | relative_url }}">{{ author.name }}</a></li>
