## Last Updated
This Documentation was last updated on 9/16/2019.

<a id="setup"></a>
## Setup

In order to run this site locally, follow the following steps:

1. Download and install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) v. 2.4.0 or higher. See [Ruby Docs - Installation](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) for more info.
    * If there's an option to install with developer kit, I recommend doing so.
2. Install [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/pages/download)
3. Install [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/) and [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
4. Download and install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). In terminal: `gem install bundler jekyll`
    * See [Jekyll Docs - Installation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#requirements) for more detailed, OS-specific instructions, as well as system requirements.
5. Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
6. Download or clone this repo. In the terminal, this is done by typing `git clone https://github.com/lunacodes/PGPGlobal.git`
7. Navigate to the directory that was just created (PGPGlobal by default, unless you gave it a custom name)
8. Terminal: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
    * In the future, you can simply run `jekyll serve`, however you may need to run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and/or `bundle install` when new plugins or other elements are added to the site.

## Jekyll Admin Graphical Editor

Only works locally

A visual interface powered by [Jekyll Admin](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-admin) is available for editing the site. Access it by appending `/admin` to the site url, ex: `localhost:4000/admin`

<a id="working-on-the-site-locally-with-git"></a>
## Working on the Site Locally with Git

1. Always run `git pull origin master` before doing any local work. This pulls any changes other people made from the online repo, and then updates your local files. If you forget to do this, you will get merge conflicts. Merge conflicts are a headache. See [Solving Merge Conflicts](#merge-conflicts) section below.

<a id="keeping-up-to-date"></a>
### Keeping Up-To-Date

In order to keep the site up-to-date with future changes, you should run `git pull` in your terminal.

<a id="branching"></a>
### Branching

If you're making more complex edits (say updating layouts or scss files), then your best bet is to create and work off of a branch. Follow the procedure below:

1. Type `git branch` to view whatever current branches are on your local repo
2. Type `git branch some_name` to make a new branch
3. Type `git checkout branch_name` to switch to the branch
4. Make your changes.

From here there are two routes:

1. Update via a pull request

Type `git push origin branch_name` to push your branch to the remote repo. Then [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request) for whoever's maintaining the repo to approve and merge your files. For an overview on pull requests, see [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests)

2. Merge the branches locally and then push to the remote repo.

Steps:

1. Type `git checkout master` to return to the main branch
2. Run `git pull origin master` to get the latest changes from the online repo
3. Type `git merge branch_name`
4. If there were no merge conflicts, then you can push to the remote repo via `git push origin master`. Otherwise, see [Solving Merge Conflicts](#merge-conflicts)

If you run into trouble with push to the remote repo, this may involve some not so simple troubleshooting. More to come on that later.

#### Staging

`git push origin local-name:remote-name`

## Files and Directories Guide

As of 8/31/19, the directory structure looks like this.

```bash
├── assets
├── _data
├── _drafts
├── _includes
├── _layouts
├── _news
├── _posts
├── _sass
│   └── partials
├── _site
│   ├── about
│   ├── assets
│   │   └── images
│   ├── blog
│   ├── contact
│   ├── docs
│   ├── news
│   └── styles
├── assets
│   └── images
├── docs
├── ref
├── scratch
└── styles

# Important files
├── _config.yml
├── Gemfile
```

<a id="directories"></a>
### Directories

* `assets` is where media files such as images, videos, etc live
* `_data` contains `navigation.yml`. This is where you edit the nav menu
* `_docs` contains all the documentation for the repo
* `_drafts` is for any incomplete blog posts
* `_includes` contains template files for things like the header, footer, nav menu, etc. These can be mixed in with differen layouts.
* `_news` contains the files for the `News` page. Each year has been seperated into its own markdown file.
* `_posts` contains all the blog posts from. These have not been included in the site just yet, due to an importation glitch I'm working out.
* `_sass` is where the styles for the site live. Sass ([Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets](https://sass-lang.com/)) is a pre-processor for CSS.  The central file is `minima.scss`, and the actual code is found in the various files in the `partials` directory. See below for more info.
* `_site` is the compiled version of the site. You can basically ignore this. Always make sure this is listed in your `.gitignore` file. You *do not* want to commit this to the repo.
* `styles` contains any extra styles that needed to be incorporated, such as [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) or other css files that are loaded separately from the main scss files

<a id="layouts-and-pages"></a>
### Layouts and Pages

* Blog Main Page is controlled by blog.md

<a id="files"></a>
### Files

Mechanical Files:

* `.gitignore` tells Git what to ignore. This is great if you have local files or folders that are helpful for you, but not relevant to anyone else. (ex: I have a `scratch` directory where I keep code snippets or unidentified miscellaneous code)
* `_config.yml` contains various settings for things like: site info, plugins, collections, and backend configuration
* `Gemfile` manages packages, plugins, and Ruby "gems"
  * There is an accompanying `Gemfile.lock`. Ignore this file, unless you know that you know for sure that you need to edit it.
*

Site Files:

Most of these should be pretty self explanatory. You'll notice that many of the files are in Markdown. Jekyll magically builds these files into the html files in the `_site` directory. If you want to exclude a file (say for example the readme or docs files), go to the `exclude` section of `_config.yml`.

**Data**

Right now the only file in `_data` is `navigation.yml`. This allows you to modify the main nav menu, and could also be used to create additional menus.

**Layouts**

The html files in the `_layouts` directory allow you to create custom templates for different page/post types.
  * Right now almost everything is using the `default.html` layout.
  * A cool feature of layouts is that they can extend other layouts. Pretty much all of the layouts currently inherit the `default.html` layout - as it sets the basic scaffolding for the pages on the site.

**Includes**

The `_includes` directory contains the various building blocks of the site (such as page head, footer, header and nav menu, etc).
* `head.html` is where all the javascript and css files are loaded, as well as where SEO and other relevant info is traditionally defined (though that's mostly being handled by jekyll plugins in our case)
* `footer` and `nav.html` are exactly what they sound like. There isn't a separate header file, since the header essentially is the nav menu.

**Posts**

Posts must be named in `yyyy-mm-dd-postname.md` format (otherwise Jekyll will ignore them). Additionally, there is a variety of metadata that posts can have - which we can make use of via Jekyll's `Liquid` templating language. See the [Liquid](#liquid) section for more info.

<a id="posts"></a>
## Posts

You can set any of the following variables in the [Front Matter]() for posts. See Jekyll Docs for more info:

* page.content
* page.title
* page.excerpt
* page.url
* page.date
* page.id
* page.categories
* page.collection
* page.tags
* page.dir
* page.name
* page.path
* The path to the raw post or page. Example usage: Linking back to the page or post’s source on GitHub. This can be overridden in the front matter.
* page.next
* page.previous

<a id="permalinks"></a>
## Permalinks

<a id="archives"></a>
### Archives

Archive permalinks work as follows:
* url.com/YYYY
* url.com/YYYY/MM
* url.com/YYYY/MM/DD
* url.com/tag/tag_name
* url.com/category/category_name

<a id="catgories"></a>
### Catgories
Archive permalinks work as follows:
url.com/category - main category page
url.com/category/category_name

Currently categories must be added manually in the `_categories` directory.

Sample Category file:

```markdown
---
tag: uncategorized
permalink: "/category/uncategorized"
---
```

The category pages are a [collection](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/) and are set to auto-generate pages based on the files in the `_categories` dir. This is set via `output: true` in `_config.yml`
