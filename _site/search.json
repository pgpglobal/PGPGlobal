      "content"  : "Recently, my co-worker Abram Connelly scraped the phenotypes in the Harvard Personal Genome Project and made it available in a small SQLite database, publicly available for anyone to download. He made a small webapp around the database where people can play around with the data directly in their browser.Current webapp (first page has link to gzip of the database) is linked to at the top of this page.datasetThe dataset consists of people who have completed the enrollment process and were free to upload their own data for public release and also answer the surveys online (but not necessarily people who have donated samples, had the samples sequence, or had the samples released publicly).To put it concretely, there are around 4000 people enrolled, and around 200 people with whole genome sequences that were  sequenced, interpreted, and returned by Harvard PGP as of August 2015 (though keep your ears open for upcoming news). (Participants may have whole genomes sequenced independently and then elect to upload and donate the data to the Harvard PGP).webappReturning to the webapp, there are a few default tabs, where you can do things like explore what year PGP participants were born, where you can see that our population is mostly young folks..."Summary" Pre-Packaged View of Allergies of Participants...or with two clicks see what allergies are most common in PGP participants. Note that this is a quick scrape of the Tapestry database and no clean-up has been done, so you'll notice allergies being listed twice with different spellings.http://gfycat.com/ifr/EvenEnormousElephantbeetleSQL Queries for Participants with "Oak" AllergiesOn the "queries" tab, you can query the sql database and see the results in neat table form in your browser.http://gfycat.com/ifr/NiftyExcellentKoalaAdditionally, there are some pre-packaged but interactive visualizations, where you can edit the text and have the graph update to reflect your changes / newly requested data.For instance, here's a display of the participant gender ratio at different ages which I modify to display information about the allergies at different age bucketsbefore, displaying gender of participants&nbsp;and after, displaying penicillin and house dust allergies&nbsp;Obligatory cat statisticshttp://gfycat.com/ifr/DearContentAracariAlthough one could hope that this graph shows that PGP participants are not more likely to develop allergies to cats as they grow older, we have a lot more younger participants and this is absolute and not percent frequency, so we might have to say the data points to the opposite. Sad!(Disclaimer: Just for fun, no real thought put into this analysis :] )ConclusionEver wanted a public genotype + phenotype dataset? The Harvard PGP has you covered!We have phenotype surveys galore (including a recently released one that includes blood type and eye color), with responses available in CSV form. The questions on the survey forms are available on github for now.I hope you all enjoy! The source code for Untap is on githubhttps://github.com/abeconnelly/untapand Abram welcomes feature requests / issue reporting.

I think I've joined at a great time, when the Harvard PGP has the world's largest public dataset that has whole genome sequences linked with genotypes.I'm excited to join in what I view as an effort that addresses the inherent ethical issues in genomics research: genomes are as individual as a fingerprint, and to stretch the analogy a bit, a smudged fingerprint (de-identified) or summaries of large amounts of fingerprints (aggregation) is only so useful, especially as with the rise of precision medicine we start targeting smaller and smaller subsets of the population with precision medicine.I think there are many challenges in the HPGP right now, among them challenges in funding and staffing, which contribute to a lot of frustration on behalf of participants, many who have donated blood and saliva samples and waited months and even years without a returned sample from us.As I've worked with the HPGP staff over the last few months, I've come to see that every last one of the staff members is working extremely hard to get samples sequenced and genomes returned. However, none of us work on HPGP full-time and we also rely on donated effort from other organization, such as sequencing centers (which we're very grateful for!). Although our pace may seem slow, I'm still really impressed by how much work has been done already.I also like to brainstorm about the future. A future where, among other things, you might be able to check on the status of your genome ala Domino's Pizza instead of having to email us and have to wait for us to laboriously reply to the many emails we get each week.(just kidding).On that note, happy fall everyone!Thanks,--Nancy Ouyang"

The Alan and Priscilla Oppenheimer Foundation seeks to advance humanity through scientific research and education and has been a long-time supporter of the Harvard Personal Genome Project. The views of this guest post, and responses from participants reported upon here, do not necessarily reflect the views of the Harvard Personal Genome Project. It is important to keep in mind that the Harvard Personal Genome Project study is not intended nor expected to help participants diagnose or improve personal health issues.Following up on our previous blog post, here’s a quick summary of the results of the Harvard Personal Genome Project enrollee survey “What are you looking for in your genome, and how can we help you find it?” There were about 280 respondents.The first questions were about the participant's background. The “average” participant has been in PGP about 3 years, may or may not have donated a sample, is most interested in inherited disease risk, has 23andMe or FamilyTree/Ancestry DNA data, and is very computer savvy, reading articles/journals.In terms of the key question in the title of the survey, participants would slightly prefer their genome analysis through either current tools like GET-Evidence and Promethease or an easy-to-use overview tool, versus raw data or a genome browser (see figure below). Primary important factors in exploring their genome include medical analysis and broad, flexible in-depth data, both slightly favored over ease-of-use and accessibility of an overview (and significantly favored over the ability to share/compare with family members).The most interesting items from the survey were the comments, mainly in the free-form “What else would you like to tell us” question at the end (entered by about 1/3 of the respondents). Most prevalent of those were:“here’s what’s wrong with me that I’m hoping my genome will help me find/understand/fix” (which is thus the number one answer to the title of the survey)“I wish there was a blood collection event in my area.”Thanks to everyone who took part. Our next step after this survey: decide on what tool(s) we here at the Oppenheimer Foundation should start building (or assisting the Personal Genome Project with) to best address the survey responses."

      "content"  : "[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcLhLU2DQss]If a major goal of genomics research is to understand the underlying molecular causes of beneficial phenotypes, for purposes of promoting overall health in society, then perhaps sports, in many regards, can help facilitate this process. The canonical athletic phenotype, with highly desirable physical traits, may serve as a model for understanding optimal fitness. And certainly professional athletes, at the pinnacle of their respective sport, have tremendous social and economic influence by inspiring everyday athletes and fans alike to emulate their performances. Therefore, a deeper understanding (or at least discussion) of what makes an “elite” athlete, or who has the potential to become one, is warranted. With 99% percent of the human genome being identical, is it plausible to think we all have the inherent ability to become elite athletes? Or, do the remaining 30 million divergent nucleotides of our genetic code determine who can or cannot become an Olympian? At the annual Genes, Environment, and Traits (GET) conference, a sports genomics panel was held to discuss this provocative topic. Invited speakers were:David Epstein. Investigative reporter at ProPublica, former senior writer for Sports Illustrated, author of the New York Times best seller The Sports Gene.Heidi Rehm, PhD. Chief Lab Director at Partners’ Laboratory for Molecule Medicine, associate professor of Pathology at Brigham &amp; Women's Hospital, expert on genomic medicine &amp; integrating genetic discovery into clinicsMark Gerstein, PhD. Professor of Bioinformatics at Yale University, expert in human genome mining &amp; annotation, author on over 400 computational biology research publications.Jonathan Scheiman (moderator), a research fellow in the genomics laboratory of George Church, former Division I athlete, and NBA correspondent for an international radio show.In a lively debate at the 2014 GET Conference – which included moments of scientific inquiry, levity, and moral contemplation – panelists engaged in discourse over the inheritability and trainability of athletic traits as well as selective pressure from society to enrich for performance phenotypes. Additional topics discussed included:Evolution of athletic body typesPerformance enhancing polymorphismsGenetic tests and specialization of athletes at a young ageGenetic tests for ensuring athlete health – requisite or optional?Whole genome sequencing of elite athletes for beneficial allele discoveryProfessional athlete salaries vs. science funding – can we collaborate?!?Quantified self and advanced analytics in professional sportsThe future and potential of genomics in sports analyticsCompetition, fairness, and genetic engineeringPractice vs. genetics. Nature vs. nurture. A timeless debate, with a new quantitative spin from current cutting edge advances in next generation genomics technologies. Never before has society had access to such powerful tools to read and write DNA. And athletes, with a history of transcending sport, are as are as popular as ever in mainstream culture. Perhaps the next revolution in science will entail a sports star allowing us all to peak into their biological greatness. Scientists vs. athletes? Why? As the sports genomics panel at the GET conference displayed, these are two communities that stand to benefit from playing on the same team.Watch the video.(special thanks to moderator Jonathan Scheiman for this written summary)"

We'd like to share more about who we are and why we're inviting PGP Harvard participants to take this survey. Although this survey is limited to PGP Harvard participants, we invite others to keep reading. Big changes are ahead that will start affecting us all!About our foundationWe are a small science-focused family foundation, started in 2007. We knew we were small, but we still wanted to think big. When we became aware of Dr. Church's new Personal Genome Project, we realized that it provided a great opportunity for a foundation like ours to make a big difference. We felt quite privileged when Dr. Church and his team said we could work with them, helping out where we could.A few of the areas in which we feel we have made a difference include:prototyping the current sequencing effort by sponsoring one of the first genomes beyond the original PGP 10creating the initial study guide which helped potential PGP participants learn about genomics and pass the entrance exam (a predecessor to the current one)helping out with a number of aspects of the GET conferencesand, most recently, planning and putting together the current survey.Our faith in the PGP in particular and personalized health in general has been validated through a number of recent developments, President Obama's newly announced Precision Medicine initiative being the most visible. Also, as indicated in the recent email, it’s great to see that the PGP has been able to send out almost all submitted enrollee blood samples for sequencing, that the project has spread from Harvard to Canada, the UK, Austria, and beyond, and has spun off important related efforts such as Open Humans.About our surveyAs the cost of a complete human genome sequence falls towards the $1000 mark, and such sequencing begins to become commonplace, it’s now time to ask the gratifying but difficult question of "What's next?". For the foundation, the answer is related to understanding what our now-obtainable complete sequence means. Helping to address this question has always been an underlying goal of the PGP, but it is only with recent successes that we have been able to begin focusing on it.The current survey is our attempt to understand the ways in which PGP enrollees (and by extension many others worldwide) want to try to learn about, explore and understand their genomes. With that data in hand we can then focus our limited resources on one or two key tools to aid in that exploration. If you’re enrolled in PGP, we’d thus very much appreciate your taking our 10-minute survey.Thank you for your time and your interest in personal genomics.Alan and Priscilla OppenheimerThe Alan &amp; Priscilla Oppenheimer Foundationhttp://www.oppenheimerfoundation.org&nbsp;"

This means, even if you remove your name from the data, it's possible for someone to determine your identity. Almost 4,000 people have enrolled knowing that privacy cannot be guaranteed, and many of them are proudly public about their data.However, to an outside viewer, the data looks anonymous! PGP Harvard's profiles have random identifiers (huID numbers). Even for the staff, we're often unsure whether a participant considers their name to be publicly associated with the profile or not. Sometimes participants do things that seem to indicate they believe their information is public by including their real name in an upload, uploading a photograph, or mentioning their participant ID in another forum. Until now there has been no way for a participant to explicitly choose to associate their name with their data on our website [1].We'd like the project to look less anonymous and we want to let participants be clear about when they consider their name to be a public fact associated with their data. So we've added to the website a feature that allows a participant to associate their real name. (This is based on their first and last name in our system, which they signed the consent form with.)To share your real name as a PGP Harvard participant: (1) log in to your account on my.pgp-hms.org, (2) select "Public Profile" from the "Participate" menu, (3) edit the "Real Name" section at the top of this page.  Here is a screenshot:More genomes comingIn addition to providing the real names feature to PGP participants, we are also working on processing a new data set received from Complete Genomics, the company responsible for most of the sequencing done by PGP Harvard.This data comes from around 200 blood samples collected in the past year and a half, including the 2013 GET conference. At this point the most of these genomes have been sequenced and are waiting to be analyzed and approved. We hope to start releasing these to participants soon.Participants will have a 30- day period to review their data and decide whether or not to withdraw. For everyone that remains a participant, the data will then become public. We look forward to sharing this data and expanding our public resource!--[1] There are many participants that have publicly associated their names with their profiles, most notably the first ten participants in PGP Harvard (the "PGP-10"). However, these associations weren't done within the participant website, but were done in other contexts (e.g. conferences, news articles, press releases, blog posts etc)."

      "content"  : "The following is a copy of our comments as submitted through the online interface at genomicsandhealth.org.These comments pertain to the International Code of Conduct for Genomic and Health-Related Data Sharing - DRAFT # 6, produced by the Regulatory and Ethics Working Group of the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health. That draft document can be found at this URL: [http://genomicsandhealth.org/our-work/work-products/international-code-conduct-genomic-and-health-related-data-sharing-draft-6](http://genomicsandhealth.org/our-work/work-products/international-code-conduct-genomic-and-health-related-data-sharing-draft-6)Our most important points are the first two. The first suggests an explicit mandate to inform individuals, families, and communities regarding identifiability of their data. The second suggests individuals, families, and communities from whom data is derived also be considered as potential data sharing recipients.These comments come from the following Personal Genome Project (PGP)-associated contributors:Misha Angrist (PersonalGenomes.org Board Member)Madeleine P Ball (PGP Harvard, Director of Research &amp; PersonalGenomes.org staff member)Stephan Beck (PGP United Kingdom, Director)Jason R Bobe (PersonalGenomes.org Executive Director &amp; PGP Harvard, Director of Community)Michael F Chou (PGP Harvard, Director of Human Subjects Research)George M Church (PGP Harvard, Principal Investigator &amp; PersonalGenomes.org President)Preston W Estep (PGP Harvard, Director of Gerontology and Director of Collections)Rifat Hamoudi (PGP United Kingdom, Computational Analysis and Development Leader)Ryan Phelan (PersonalGenomes.org Board Member)Jane Kaye (PGP United Kingdom, Ethics and Social Implications Leader)Jeantine E Lunshof (PGP Harvard, Ethics Consultant)Michelle N Meyer (PersonalGenomes.org Board Member)Stephen W Scherer (PGP Canada, Principal Investigator)Alexander Wait Zaranek (PGP Harvard, Director of Informatics)1. We strongly suggest explicitly stating participants be informed about identifiability.(Section 4, Guidelines 4.2)To respect individuals, families, and communities, and to foster trust and integrity, we strongly believe the foundational principles should mean that individuals, families, and communities be informed about the identifiability of data relating to them. In particular, participants should be informed of the inherent identifiability of an individual from their genome, or from genotype profiling of multiple loci in their genome. To make this clear, section 4.2 of the guidelines:4.2 Informing individuals, families and communities about the use and exchange of data relating to them, depending on the nature of the data.Could be changed to specifically mention identifiability:4.2 Informing individuals, families and communities about the use and exchange of data relating to them, including its identifiability, depending on the nature of the data.2. We strongly suggest reciprocal consideration of data sharing to and from individuals.(Section 4, Guidelines 5.2)To respect individuals, families, and communities, and to foster trust and reciprocity, we strongly believe the foundational principles should mean that individuals, families, and communities from whom data are derived also be considered as potential data sharing recipients. To reflect this, section 5.2 of the guidelines could be updated to also describe consideration of the risks of data sharing to/with individuals, families, and communities (in addition to on/about):5.2 Considering the realistic harms and benefits of data sharing on individuals, families and communities, including opportunity costs.To also state “with” individuals, families, and communities:5.2 Considering the realistic harms and benefits of data sharing on and with individuals, families and communities, including opportunity costs associated with both sharing and not sharing.Additional Recommendations3. We suggest avoiding some terms with markedly variable legal meaning.(Preamble &amp; Section 1)There are a couple of terms in the draft that have meanings that vary considerably depending on country and legal context. Because this document is intended to convey global policy, we suggest avoiding these terms and, if appropriate, replacing them with terms which avoid unintended or inconsistent legal interpretation.The first of these is the phrase “moral interests”. One interpretation of this is as “moral rights”, a term that, to our knowledge, varies markedly in its legal meaning. While we recognize the phrase “moral interests” reflects language in Article 27 of the UDHR, we recommend possibly avoiding it to reduce divergent understandings of the meaning of this document.The other phrase with variable legal meaning is the term “good faith”. As with “moral rights”, in some countries and legal contexts “good faith” has a concrete legal meaning and can be breached. In other contexts, it is an appeal for fair behavior with no legal force.4. We wonder if there is an expectation that this code may be binding, beyond the signees?(Section 2)If not generally binding or enforceable, we suggest changing the phrase:This code applies toTo state:This code can potentially be applied to5. We suggest wording changes to the founding principles.(Section 3)The third foundational principle refers to what seems like two principles that aren't strongly related: “advancing research” and “fair distribution of [research] benefits”. Also, because genomics research is often not related to health (e.g. ancestry), emphasis on “health and wellbeing” as a principle in themselves (the first principle) could be seen as implicitly excluding these fields of research. We suggest stronger emphasis of “research and scientific knowledge” would be more inclusive. Because “health and wellbeing” seem more related to “fair distribution of benefits”, we suggest rewording the foundational principles from:1. Promote Health and Wellbeing2. Respect Individuals, Families and Communities3. Advance Research and the Fair Distribution of Benefits4. Foster Trust, Integrity and ReciprocityTo instead be:1. Advance Research and Scientific Knowledge2. Respect Individuals, Families and Communities3. Promote Health, Wellbeing, and Fair Distribution of Benefits4. Foster Trust, Integrity and Reciprocity6. We suggest explicitly recognizing donors as actors in consent.(Section 4)In keeping with the second foundational principle (respect for individuals, families, and communities), we suggest explicitly naming “donors” as those who are giving consent in this sentence:This Code applies to data that has been consented to for use and/or approved therefor by competent authorities.To state:This Code applies to data that has been consented to by donors (or their legal representatives) for use and/or approved therefor by competent authorities.7. We suggest specifying data provenance trace to the data source.(Section 4, Guidelines 2.1)To enable investigators to ensure that their data has been generated from well-consented sources, we recommend updating the phrase:...tracking the chain of data exchange.to state:...tracking the chain of data exchange to its source.8. We suggest avoiding potentially implying that perfect data security can be achieved.(Section 4, Guidelines 3.3)Because perfect data security is not achievable, we recommend changing the phrase:Installing strict data security measures to prevent unauthorized access, data loss and misuse....To state:Installing strict data security measures to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, data loss and misuse....9. We suggest clarifying Part 5 of the Guidelines to communicate balancing of risk and benefit.(Section 4, Guidelines 5)The title for this section, “Minimizing Harm and Maximizing Benefits”, refers two very different extremes in decision-making. To communicate balancing consideration, we recommend changing the phrase and title:minimizing harm and maximizing benefitsTo instead be:risk-benefit analysisIt was also unclear to us what outcomes would be considered as potential harms or benefits; it might also be helpful to give examples of these."

      "content"  : "I'm happy to announce the publication of our paper "Harvard Personal Genome Project: lessons from participatory research" in Genome Medicine, a general retrospective of the current Harvard Personal Genome Project. There is growing interest in participatory research and data sharing (with either participants or researchers), and the Harvard PGP has concrete experience relevant to these conversations. In this paper we share our experiences with the hope of encouraging and assisting others interested in similar research models.In the rest of the post I’ll give some personal summary, written colloquially. Although many observations seem obvious or trivial, remember that hindsight is 20/20! This wasn’t always what people expected, and that’s why it’s important to share our experiences.What happens when your project gives participants data access?One thing that doesn’t happen (at least, not yet): the sky doesn’t fall. Our report explores this question in the form of quantifying the communications we receive from participants. Only one in ten participants that received access to whole genome data through the PGP followed up with us asking any questions about that data – and the majority of those questions were regarding file formats and additional files, not interpretation.1 For a project whose public image is "Personal Genomes!" (and whose participants are extremely engaged and interested in genomes), I think this is a very modest amount of "customer support". This should be reassuring to any project considering providing genetic data access to its participants.One thing that does happen: when you tell participants you plan to give them data, they wonder where the data is. Over a quarter of our communications are from participants eager to be sampled and receive data. Research timelines are slow. Sometimes analyses fail. It’s really hard to tell someone "Your sample from 14 months ago is still sitting in the freezer".2 Participants are used to medical tests and commercial products which return results in days or weeks. But those tests are fast because commercial/clinical providers have developed standard, polished processes. Researchers have a much fuzzier idea of where they're going – that’s why it’s research! – and things almost never go as smoothly as the researcher imagines they will.3Unexpected positive consequences of public participatory researchWhat happens when you have a public project and don’t promise anonymity? Participants talk to each other! They create forums, they write books, they report on their experiences. They can even complain about you – a powerful empowerment of participants.But researchers, don't shy away from this scary new world where participants become people. There are some significant benefits for your work when participants become part of your community. An engaged cohort wants to be studied! They go out of their way to give you samples. They give you data. They find errors. They perform follow-up investigations and tell you what happened. You get participants who don't merely expect you to study them, they study themselves.1: Regarding that interpretation – our interpretation process is semi-automatic and creates fairly limited, highly technical summaries (these genome reports are publicly shared on GET-Evidence).2: Part of why it's hard is because the answers are often embarrassing, e.g. "Alexandra started that project, but she moved to Tokyo and nobody can read her notes". (This is hypothetical! I think the Harvard PGP has done much better than this! But it's not an unusual story.)3: Researchers are also generally optimistic about timelines. If the researcher says it should take two weeks, expect it to take six. Maybe ten. If you think about it, it's just human nature – to want to do the research in the first place, the researcher must be excited and optimistic about it!"

As the ethics advisor to the Personal Genome Project, Jeantine, along with George, has pioneered our "open consent" model for public data sharing. With this piece, Lunshof et al. address the topic of sharing data with participants themselves. They advocate that participants deserve access to raw data in any research and clinical setting, to establish fairness and reciprocity in research and any other context where data are handed over.This vision is very much in line with the Personal Genome Project's work since 2005, and more recently with our public comments on the NIH draft Genomic Data Sharing Policy last November and our recently funded Open Humans Network. Data relevant to understanding human health and biology is often very personal, very identifiable, and – as a result – difficult to share. Participant-mediated data sharing is a way to enable open human data.As Lunshof, Church, and Prainsack point out, modern information technology should facilitate data sharing with participants. It is understandable that such a model has been impractical in the past, but the technology is now ready. To make it a reality, we need to see our expectations change regarding how research studies should operate.Lunshof et al. make a careful distinction between "access to data" and "return of findings" – the first is the raw research data alone, while the latter involves interpretation of that data (a process sometimes requiring instrument certification or clinical expertise). Their piece challenges researchers to treat access to raw research data as a separate issue from its interpretation; they call for researchers to grant raw data access and thereby promote participant agency, establishing a more fair and reciprocal relationship."

The winners were announced at the Clinton Foundation Health Matters Conference on January 14, 2014 in La Quinta, CA.The John S. and James L. Knight Foundation is the leading funder of journalism and media innovation. It has been seeking the next generation of innovations to inform and engage communities.With its Knight News Challenge: Health, the Knight Foundation is funding breakthrough ideas that harness data and information for the health of communities. The five-stage competition began in August 2013 with an “Inspiration Phase” during which anyone could post needs, interests, and ideas online at its website, and continued with the submission of 630 health and data news projects, all competing for a share of $2.2 million in funding and support. After a feedback stage, 39 semi-finalists – the Open Humans Network among them—were invited to refine their projects and submit videos prior to judging. Seven winners were awarded grants.The Open Humans Network, led by myself and Madeleine Ball of PersonalGenomes.org, attempts to break down health data silos through an online portal that will connect participants willing to share data about themselves publicly with researchers who are interested in using that public data and contributing their analyses and insight to it. The portal will showcase public health data and facilitate its exploration and download. The Open Humans Network ultimately hopes to revolutionize research by making it easy for anyone to participate in research projects and facilitating highly integrated, longitudinal health data. This portal will consist of three components: individual data profile pages, a public data explorer and a set of design guidelines for researchers seeking a collaborative data-sharing model.The Open Humans Network grows out of the Personal Genome Project (PGP), a research study founded in 2005 that has pioneered open-access sharing of genomic and trait data.  Through our years of work on the PGP, we recognized the need to link together the people and data from many exciting open research efforts.Current partners with the Open Humans Network include the Harvard Personal Genome Project (PI: George Church, Harvard Medical School), American Gut project (PI: Rob Knight, University of Colorado, Boulder), Flu Near You: GoViral Study (Rumi Chunara, Boston Children’s Hospital) and the Mt. Sinai School of Medicine (Eric Schadt, Icahn Institute). By helping participants locate legitimate, open research projects and promoting data sharing, the Open Humans Network will allow any individual to make valuable contributions to science.We believe that everyone benefits from a health research community that is more transparent, efficient, and equitable. Toward this end, we aim to reimagine health research and biodiscovery! Our sleeves are already rolled up, and we are tremendously excited to have the support from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation’s Knight News Challenge to help us make our vision a reality.For more information, visit us at: http://openhumans.orgJason Bobe Executive Director PersonalGenomes.org-- 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization"

Using participant-reported symptoms, Flu Near You graphs and maps this information to provide local and national views of influenza-like illness.This year we are recruiting people from Massachusetts for GoViral; a next-generation study that will revolutionize infectious disease prevention and awareness by making it community-based and data-driven.GoViral combines for the first time, online crowdsourced data and diagnostic samples that people can provide themselves from their homes.What will GoViral participants do?Participants will receive a weekly survey (via email or push notification on our smartphone app) that takes about 20 seconds to fill out, asking which of 10 symptoms you had in the previous week. Participants will also receive a GoViral test kit they can keep at home. If at anytime you get sick with a fever and sore throat or cough, you will be asked to provide a really easy to obtain spit and/or nasal-swab sample. Participants will also receive a Do-It-Yourself home test that detects 4 different kinds of flu and cold viruses, and all samples will be analyzed at a central laboratory that checks for 20 different viral infections. The kits can be returned by USPS and results from these tests will be used for research purposes only.We will be collecting and testing samples throughout the flu season (until about April). At the end of the season will ask participants to fill out a short survey (2 minutes) about how the information affected their behavior. Flu Near You is completely free to use. Data from each group will be aggregated and visualized in an easy to interpret yet anonymized manner.GoViral Participants will be able to track their own history throughout the season and as well, through the aggregate data, be able to see in real-time what infections and symptoms are going around right near them so they can take appropriate public health measures and understand when something might be abnormal. How can PGP volunteers specially contribute or benefit from the GoViral project?Influenza happens every year and no groups are exempt! There are still a lot of open questions including how many people actually get the flu or another type of respiratory infection. This platform enables us to learn more without relying on who goes in to see the doctor, as not all people do. As well, we believe this type of platform can help keep people healthy by providing them with very relevant information.We think that PGP volunteers would be great participants because they are excited about and knowledgeable about the valuable information that individuals can hold in regards to our health. In the future it would be interesting to examine genetic makeup and predisposition for respiratory infections!For the first year of the study we are only recruiting people in Massachusetts, but in subsequent years we can expand to other locations around the country.Learn more and join here: http://flunearyou.org/goviral--NOTE: Enrolled Harvard PGP participants may find more information about this and other studies inside the third party activities page."
