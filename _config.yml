  The Personal Genome Project, initiated in 2005, is a vision and coalition
  of projects across the world dedicated to creating
  public genome, health, and trait data.
  Sharing data is critical to scientific progress, but has been hampered by
  traditional research practices. The PGP approach is to invite
  willing participants to publicly share their personal data for the greater good.
