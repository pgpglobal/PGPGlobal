<p>Many thanks to the PGP participants who have already donated exome data! We are working to feature these and other donated data on our site.</p>
<p>Customers using 23andme's pilot exome service may have recently received an email from 23andme notifying them that online hosting of their exome data will end soon (at the end of August). Before this occurs, we would like to communicate to our participants how they can donate this data, if they wish to do so.</p>
<p>It is ideal to have the full data set donated (BAM data as well as the VCF file). These files are large and difficult to upload. We believe the easiest method for participants to donate this data is to provide the Personal Genome Project with the information needed for download (as given to you by 23andme):<br />
(1) the Amazon Web Services URL<br />
(looks like: https://exome-export.s3.amazonaws.com/AB1234_C56DE78a9b.tc)<br />
(2) the decryption password<br />
(looks like a random string, e.g. "XahN7tah4s")</p>
<p>With this information we can download the data directly and decrypt it. An email from you containing this information will be treated as a "public donation of data" to the PGP and may be made public immediately. (Making the BAM data public may take some time though. You can check the status of things by seeing what is visible on your public profile.)</p>
<p>To email us, please log in to your participant account on my.personalgenomes.org and click the "Contact Us" button. By receiving the information through your participant account, we can confirm that the donation was personally made by the participant.</p>
<p>Please let us know if you would rather share the data with us in some other manner. Thanks again to all our participants!</p>
