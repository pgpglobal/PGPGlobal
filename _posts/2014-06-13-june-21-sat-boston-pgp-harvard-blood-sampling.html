<p>We've collected blood in Boston before at the GET conference, but attending the event isn't always possible for local residents, so we've decided to hold a blood collection event on a weekend. We're planning a sample collection at Harvard Medical School next Saturday June 21st, 10am-4pm.</p>
<p>PGP Harvard participants who have completed the PGP Participant Survey and all twelve trait surveys are invited to apply to donate blood. Also, this is for folks that aren't already in the sequencing pipeline - no need to attend if you already have a genome or gave blood at GET2013 or GET2014. To apply, please log in to your participant account at <a href="my.pgp-hms.org">my.pgp-hms.org</a> and visit <a href="https://my.pgp-hms.org/user/study/21">the collection event page</a>. You can complete surveys (or check if you've already done them) by visiting <a href="https://my.pgp-hms.org/google_surveys">the trait surveys page</a>.</p>
