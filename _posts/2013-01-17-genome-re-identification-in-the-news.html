<p><a href="http://www.nature.com/msb/journal/v1/n1/full/msb4100040.html">Since its founding</a>, the Personal Genome Project has only accepted participants who understand and acknowledge re-identification as a potential risk. This "open consent" approach arose from <a href="http://arep.med.harvard.edu/pdf/Lunshof08.pdf">our argument</a> that privacy may be over-promised and that re-identification is increasingly possible as technology advances.</p>
<p>Dramatic progress in re-identification has been published today in Science (Gymrek et al.), and is reported on in Wired (<a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2013/01/your-genome-could-reveal-your-identity/">"Scientists Discover How to Identify People From ‘Anonymous’ Genomes"</a>). Wired's article features some quotes from George Church and highlights our project.</p>
