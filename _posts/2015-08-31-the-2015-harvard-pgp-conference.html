<p>Next month, the Harvard Personal Genome Project will hold its annual U.S. conference (<strong>MindEx 2015</strong>) and labs events (<strong>PG-Palooza</strong>) in Cambridge, MA. The conference will take place on Saturday, September 12 at Harvard University's famed Sanders Theatre. PG-Palooza labs will be held on Sunday, September 13 at the Cambridge Innovation Center. Thanks to the generosity of our sponsors, all PGP participants will be admitted to both MindEx and PG-Palooza for free!</p>
<p>In years past, the PGP was featured at the GET Conference. This year, the GET Conference is going international. It will take place in <a href="http://www.getconference.org/">Vienna </a>(Sept 17-19, http://www.getconference.org/) and will feature Genom Austria, and other members of the growing international PGP consortium.</p>
<p>For this year's U.S. MindEx conference, the Harvard PGP is working together with the Mind First Foundation, and a focus of the conference will be the mental realm: mind and brain, cognition and behavior. Still, as in previous years, the U.S. conference and labs will provide its established focus on open source genomics and citizen participatory science.</p>
