<p><b></b><span style="font-weight:400;">We're thrilled to announce that data from the Harvard Personal Genome Project is being used in a challenge this year presented by the Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation (CAGI). CAGI challenges test the ability of researchers to interpret genome data and make phenotype predictions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">PGP data is uniquely valuable for these challenges as it is completely "open source": the algorithms </span><span style="font-weight:400;">and</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> data can be completely open. In this challenge, experimenters are asked to predict matching phenotype profiles for a set of genomes.
