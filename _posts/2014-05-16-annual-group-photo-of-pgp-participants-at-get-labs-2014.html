<p>Taking a group photo of Harvard Personal Genome Project participants in attendance at the GET Conference has become a fun annual tradition (<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/personalgenomes/14008052589/in/photostream/">2014</a>, <a href="http://blog.personalgenomes.org/2013/05/10/group-photo-of-pgp-participants-at-2013-get-conference/">2013</a>, <a href="http://blog.personalgenomes.org/2012/05/07/making-the-pgp-more-personal-participation-highlights-from-get2012-and-looking-ahead-to-get2013/">2012</a>).  This year, the group photo was taken on April 29, 2014 at the <a href="http://www.getconference.org/GET2014/labs.html">GET Labs</a> event held at the IBM Innovation Center in Cambridge MA:</p>
