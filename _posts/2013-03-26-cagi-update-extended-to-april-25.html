<p>My apologies to the Personal Genome Project participants whose genomes are still "anonymous" and not yet added to their public profile. The CAGI team really wanted to provide competitors with one more month of time to make predictions, and so their challenge has <a href="https://genomeinterpretation.org/content/2012-challenges">extended to the end of DNA Day</a> (11:59pm PST). We'll be able to publicly release these genomes to PGP profiles the day after that.</p>
