<p>The <a href="https://genomeinterpretation.org/">Critical Assessment of Genome Interpretation</a> (CAGI) challenge for <a href="https://genomeinterpretation.org/content/PGP2012">predicting traits for 77 PGP genomes</a> is still open for most of the month -- the challenge is scheduled to end on March 28. CAGI's <a href="https://genomeinterpretation.org/content/Feb2013">latest news update</a> also announces their conference will be in July, in Berlin, and lists several other challenges. There's still a lot of time to do analyses, visit their site if you're interested in participating.</p>
<p>Thanks again to the PGP participants who volunteered their genomes to be used by CAGI. Once the challenge is done your genomes will be linked from your public PGP profiles. We hope the PGP's uniquely public data facilitates dialogue and leads to publicly shared methods for genome interpretation.</p>
