<p><em>Madeleine Price Ball, PhD is a PGP research scientist in George Church's lab at Harvard Medical School.</em></p>
<p>This is a personal post, my recent story of personal genomic analysis. Although I am not a PGP participant, the story is an illustration of the personal empowerment that can be realized by having access to one's own genetic data.</p>
<p>The personal context for this news is that I'm pregnant, and two weeks ago I found out I was carrying a boy.</p>
<p>Normally such news would be interesting, but neither good nor bad. In my case, however, I was really hoping for a girl – for some concrete reasons of family history. I have two uncles (my mother's brothers) with mental retardation, likely caused by an unknown mutation. If that mutation is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-linked_recessive_inheritance">X-linked</a>, there's a chance I'm a carrier for that X-linked mutation. If I have a boy, there's a chance I could pass it on to him.</p>
<p>Assuming it is X-linked, what are my chances of being a carrier? My mother had a 50% chance of inheriting it and I had a 50% chance of inheriting one from her – a total of 25% chance (50% of 50%). However I have something in my favor that makes this chance lower: I have two brothers who are clearly unaffected. Applying this new information to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes'_theorem">Bayesian calculation</a>, my mother's chance of being a carrier becomes 20% and my own becomes 10%.</p>
<p>I would have a 5% chance of passing it on to a male child (50% of 10%). Of course, whatever they have might not be X-linked (see footnote). I estimate the chances their issue is X-linked is around 50%, which would make the risk 2-3% instead of 5%. This is small but not trivial – it's like the risk a 44-year-old woman would have for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome">Down Syndrome</a> in her child. It is standard to offer such an expectant mother the option to test her fetus and choose to abort it (a common decision, if controversial). I have no such option, we can't test for a mutation if we don't know what it is.</p>
<p>And so, when I told my mother the sex, she decided to try to have her brothers diagnosed ASAP. It's not something she wanted to do, it would be difficult – it would require discussion with their caretakers, arrangements with medical providers, and it would disrupt their routine.</p>
<p>I was thinking hard about what I could do myself. My mind challenged with this new stressful information, I thought of something I could have done before now but hadn't occurred to me – I could use the genetic data from my family members to determine how much “at risk” X chromosome DNA I carry.</p>
<p>A map of the X inheritance in my family is below (apologies to colorblind people, I believe you can read “magenta, red, and cyan” as “blue, yellow/black, and gray”):</p>
<div align="center"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/20120120_x_inheritance.png" alt="" width="500" /></div>
<p>My grandmother's X's are represented as magenta (safe) and red (mutation bearing) – my aunt and mother are represented as inheriting a red/magenta mixture from her (we don't know which they got) and a cyan X from my grandfather. My sister and I inherited (1) an X from mom that is a mixture of my grandfather's cyan X and the unknown red/magenta from my grandmother, and (2) an X from our father. My brothers inherited a single X from my mother's parents – and here I've colored it as only magenta &amp; cyan, because any parts they got from my grandmother are proven to be “safe” by the fact that they are not affected.</p>
<p>Such a diagram would lead you to think that inheritance blends the DNA up pretty well each generation, but it really doesn't – in reality inheritance is extremely blocky. <a href="http://www.23andme.com/">23andme</a> provides diagrams of these blocks using the “Family Inheritance” and “Family Inheritance: Advanced” tools. Because my grandfather and brothers and I have all done 23andme, I can figure out which blocks I inherited from my grandmother and compare them to what my brothers inherited. If either of them inherited the same regions, then I knew those parts were confirmed “safe”. I only have to worry about regions I inherited from my grandmother and both brothers did not inherit.</p>
<p>Based on 23andme, I have the following maps for the X chromosomes of myself and my brothers. What I did was perform a comparison between each of us and our grandfather (all of whom have 23andme data); any regions matching my grandfather were marked as inherited from him, any remaining regions marked as from my grandmother.</p>
<div align="center"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/20120121_x_inheritance_2.png" alt="" width="500" /></div>
<p>As you can see, it looks like I'm in the clear! Amazingly, brother 2 (his name is Andrew) managed to “test” a whopping 95% of the X our mother inherited from our grandmother! Thank you Andrew, excellent work! While there's 5% from our grandmother that neither brother has, I don't have it either so it's not an issue for me. Our sister does carry that segment -- some further data from my uncles would be useful for her (do they both carry that segment?), but there is no pressure to do it quickly.</p>
<p>Because diagnosis of my uncles was never certain, it's possible this has saved me years of uncertainty as I watched the child for signs of developmental delay. I'm extremely relieved -- and I'm really happy the "direct to consumer" genetic testing industry exists, allowing me to do this analysis. The result could easily have fallen in the other direction: if I found a larger-than-expected untested fraction from our grandmother then my risk estimates would have increased rather than disappeared. I am lucky it turned out the way it did. It's a happy ending for me, and now I can return to the mundane common concerns of pregnancy and children.</p>

<hr />
<p><small><strong>Footnote:</strong> X-linked disorder was the major concern here. The other major possibility would be an “autosomal recessive” disorder, but the chances I would have an affected child even if I carried such a gene would be extremely low – Chris would also have to be a carrier for a mutation in the same gene (presumably an extremely rare event).</small></p>
<p><small>Other possibilities I could worry about carrying include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragile_X_syndrome">Fragile X</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosomal_translocation">balanced translocations</a>. Fragile X is a string of trinucleotide repeats that can expand to a disease-causing length when passed from mother to child – I suppose it's theoretically possible one or both of my brothers and I inherited “premutation” versions and that mine could expand into “mutation” when I pass it to a child. It's also theoretically possible that my grandmother had a “balanced translocation” where a disease is caused if you only get one or the other, but not if you get both – in such a situation it's possible (but very unlikely) that my mother got both, somehow only passed zero or two to each of her children, and passed the same balanced set to me. I thought both of these were very unlikely, but I was tested for them – as I suspected, I carry neither.</small></p>
