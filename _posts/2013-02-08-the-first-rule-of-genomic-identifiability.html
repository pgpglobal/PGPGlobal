<p><em><a href="http://personalgenomes.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/20130208_misha_2.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1020" alt="20130208_misha_2" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/20130208_misha_2.jpg?w=300" width="300" height="300" /></a>This is a guest blog post from <a href="http://www.genome.duke.edu/directory/faculty/angrist/">Misha Angrist, Ph.D.</a>, an <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Misha-Angrist/e/B003BZG3P2/">author</a>, assistant professor at Duke University, and PGP-4.</em></p>
<p>In the <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/genetic-privacy-needs-a-more-nuanced-approach-1.12363">7 February 2013 edition of Nature I have a commentary</a> on genomic privacy arguing that it is time to re-frame how we think about this issue. I wrote this partly in response to the <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/339/6117/321.abstract">Science paper by Gymrek et al</a> in which the authors used a combination of public genetic and genealogical data to re-identify the surnames of supposedly anonymous—or at least “de-identified”—people.</p>
<p>The initial reaction to my commentary from the senior author of the paper, <a href="http://wi.mit.edu/people/fellows/erlich">Yaniv Erlich</a>, was anger. He felt that I was denigrating his work, that I was implying that it had been done before and therefore it was not a big deal. Rereading my piece, I can see how he would think that; given a do-over and more space I reckon I would phrase some things differently. But I did not mean anything of the sort.</p>
<p>Yaniv and I had an <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=mishaAngrist%20%40erlichya%20&amp;src=typd">honest and respectful exchange</a>. His revised and measured response is <a href="http://erlichya.tumblr.com/post/42442232049/the-difference-between-an-anecdote-and-a-systematic">here</a>; I admire and appreciate his willingness to reconsider his initial reaction. I did my best to assure him that my goal was never to minimize what he and his team had done. On the contrary: Academic “privacy hackers” like Yaniv Erlich, <a href="http://dataprivacylab.org/people/sweeney/">Latanya Sweeney</a> and <a href="http://hiplab.mc.vanderbilt.edu/people/malin/">Brad Malin</a> are essential to understanding how secure our genomic data might—and might not—be.</p>
<p>What I was really trying to convey was frustration: we now have a decade’s worth of data demonstrating that genetic information is identifying. NIH (disclosure: I am a recipient of NIH funding), in its <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/339/6117/275">commentary that appears alongside the Erlich group’s paper</a>, says it is concerned about this issue, but doesn’t seem all that willing to entertain policy alternatives that fundamentally challenge the status quo. The PGP, for example, is not mentioned.</p>
<p>Folks who study human beings are nervous. Indeed, in a phone conversation today Yaniv told me that a senior colleague of his said that his paper <em>should not even be published</em> lest it lead to a shutdown of public sequencing resources.</p>
<p>Really? So genomic identifiability is like Fight Club?</p>
<hr />
<p>Three clarifications:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.businessweek.com/authors/1399-john-lauerman">John Lauerman</a> is not only monitoring his medical condition, he is actively receiving treatment: see <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/genetic-privacy-needs-a-more-nuanced-approach-1.12363#/comment-54909">Pete Estep’s comment on my piece</a>.</li>
<li>I got Yaniv’s institutional affiliation wrong. <a href="http://wi.mit.edu/">The Whitehead Institute</a> informed me that, “Yaniv Erlich is a scientist at, and employee of, Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research, where his lab is located. He does not work at <a href="http://www.mit.edu/">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a>.”</li>
<li>I should not have implied that dead people are not covered by <a href="http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/summary/index.html">HIPAA Privacy</a>. “…<a href="http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/solutions-managing-your-practice/coding-billing-insurance/hipaahealth-insurance-portability-accountability-act/frequently-asked-questions.page">the medical record of a deceased patient is subject to all restraints on disclosure that are applicable to the record of a living patient</a>.” Phew: corpses everywhere are resting easier.</li>
</ul>
