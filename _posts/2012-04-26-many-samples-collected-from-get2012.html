<p>Many thanks to all who participated, supported, and attended the GET2012 conference! Don't consider this to be our only follow-up post about the conference, I just wanted to write a brief message and share some photos of the sample collections. (One thing we'll post later is some videos online.)</p>
<p>We managed to collect blood from 110 participants and 80+ microbiome kits (we haven't counted them yet) -- it's really exciting to have so many samples! The blood will be especially valuable, many thanks to our colleagues at the <a href="http://www.feinsteininstitute.org/">Feinstein Institute</a> (the nurses who did the blood draws). Anu, Tom, and Ward all helped pack the samples up for overnight shipping to <a href="http://ccr.coriell.org/">Coriell</a> to establish blood cell lines (EBV-transformed B cells, to be shared in the NIGMS repository). Here's Tom's parting photo of the kits, as he and Anu left them at FedEx while I circled the block in a Zipcar truck:</p>

<p>And here's a snapshot we made on Monday evening, when Jeantine, Jason and I finished constructing the microbiome kits for the conference (five self-collected swabs from various body sites). Many thanks also go to John Aach &amp; Mike Chou for their invaluable help, spending the better part of the day at the reception desk handing out and receiving these kits. An avalanche of ziploc bags!</p>
