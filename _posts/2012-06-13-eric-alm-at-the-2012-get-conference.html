<p>As part of the Pioneer Session at the <a href="http://www.getconference.org">2012 GET</a> Conference, <a href="http://almlab.mit.edu/">Eric Alm</a> gave an overview of his effort to create a high resolution characterization of the microbial communities in his own gut by collecting and analyzing daily stool samples for a year (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4p3JI7s1dw&amp;feature=channel&amp;list=UL">video</a>).</p>
<p>I've heard Eric's research endearingly referred to as the "#2-ome"! Lawrence David, a former graduate student in Eric's lab at MIT, also participated in this self-study experiment. He runs an aptly named website: <a href="http://stinkpot.org">stinkpot.org</a>.</p>
