<p>I'm going to be flying to Mountain View this evening to attend the <a href="http://opensciencesummit.com/">Open Science Summit</a>. Various PGP members have attended and spoken in previous years; this year I'm up and <a href="http://opensciencesummit.com/program/">scheduled to give a 15-20 minute talk Saturday morning</a> (in the 10:45am-12:00pm PST grouping).</p>
<p>Open science is of course one of our core motivations as a project, and I look forward to meeting many like-minded folks there. Live streaming of the summit should be available at this site: <a href="http://fora.tv/conference/open_science_summit_2012/livestream">http://fora.tv/conference/open_science_summit_2012/livestream</a></p>
<p>For twitter users, the hashtag du jour will be "<a href="http://twitter.com/search?q=%23oss12">#OSS12</a>". Last minute tickets if you want to attend in person are here: <a href="http://opensciencesummit2012.eventbrite.com/">http://opensciencesummit2012.eventbrite.com/</a> (looks like $300 at this point).</p>
