<p>Quick note: Tomorrow Jeantine Lunshof, Barbara Prainsack, and John Wilbanks will have a live chat ("Do You Have a Right to Your Personal Data?") hosted by Science's senior commentary editor, Brad Wible. <a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/health/2014/01/live-chat-do-you-have-right-your-personal-data">You can join them at 3pm EST tomorrow for a live chat.</a> (You can also leave comments or questions on that page, ahead of the chat.) Also, if you haven't seen it already, their Science policy piece is publicly accessible (<a href="http://news.sciencemag.org/health/2014/01/live-chat-do-you-have-right-your-personal-data">"Raw Personal Data: Providing Access"</a>, by Lunshof, Church, and Prainsack).</p>
