<p>Blood is our current best source for getting DNA for whole genome sequencing. For PGP Harvard, GET conference blood collections in Boston have been a great success. But we know not all participants can travel to Boston for these events, so we want to pilot blood collection events in other cities. <span style="color:#262626;">Our next event will be in Mountain View next week on Wednesday May 7th, between 1pm-5pm.</span></p>
<p>PGP Harvard participants who have completed the PGP Participant Survey and all twelve trait surveys are invited to apply to donate blood. To apply, please log in to your participant account at <a href="my.pgp-hms.org">my.pgp-hms.org</a> and visit <a href="https://my.pgp-hms.org/user/study/20">the collection event page</a>. You can complete surveys (or check if you've already done them) by visiting <a href="https://my.pgp-hms.org/google_surveys">the trait surveys page</a>.</p>
