<p><em>This is a guest post from Rob Stein, Correspondent/Senior Editor at National Public Radio (NPR).</em></p>
<p>I am a reporter at NPR. I am working on a story about whole genome sequencing. I'm trying to find people who have had their genomes sequenced to interview for my story. Ideally. I'd like to find some people who are not involved in genetics professionally, but had their genomes sequenced primarily out of personal curiosity. Please contact me at: 202-513-2794 or rstein@npr.org.</p>
