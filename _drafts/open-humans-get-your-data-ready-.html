<p><a href="http://personalgenomes.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/open_human_superuser1.png"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1333" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/open_human_superuser1.png?w=234" alt="open_human_superuser" width="234" height="300" /></a>Open Humans is our exciting new project to build a place for equitable participation in research studies. Participants in Open Humans will be part of a community interested in publicly sharing their personal biological and health data for the public good. Researchers will be able to advertise their studies to Open Humans members – provided they return data to their participants, further enabling Open Humans members to share rich personal data.</p>
<p>Our one year goal is to seed our community with a some "super users" publicly sharing three types of core research data sets: genetic, microbiome, and viral. You can get started now! Visit the studies suggested below to collect the data yourself and you can bring it to Open Humans when our doors open.</p>
<h3>Genetic</h3>
<p>Whole genome data is our ultimate goal, and we will be reaching our hand out to participants in the <a href="http://personalgenomesorg-staging.elasticbeanstalk.com/harvard">Personal Genome Project at Harvard Medical School</a> to bring whole genome data to Open Humans. But PGP has more participants than it can sequence - if you don't already have a genome you can seek out some genetic data for yourself. Open Humans plans to accept raw data two leading direct-to-consumer genotyping data sets: if you don't already have genetic data, you can sign up for genotyping at <a href="https://www.23andme.com/">23andme</a> or <a href="https://www.familytreedna.com/family-finder-compare.aspx">Family Tree DNA's Family Finder</a>.</p>
<h3>Microbiome</h3>
<p>Open Humans is also thrilled to be partnering with the <a href="http://americangut.org/">American Gut</a> project to build open microbiome data. American Gut is an exciting crowdfunded project founded by Rob Knight's lab at the University of Colorado. [How does your microbiome compare to others?] You can <a href="https://fundrazr.com/campaigns/4Tqx5">sign up to American Gut through their fund-raising site</a>. Once you use your kit and send it in, you'll be on track for having access to personal microbiome data that you can share on Open Humans.</p>
<h3>Viral</h3>
<p><a href="https://flunearyou.org/">Flu Near You</a> is an ongoing participatory project that collects weekly surveys about your illnesses. It's super easy to do - a weekly email or smartphone reminder prompts you to for a quick response. Most weeks you'll have nothing to report, but when you do get sick isn't it nice that you can use that data for science? You should also sign up for <a href="https://www.flunearyou.org/goviral">the GoViral addition</a>: participants receive test kits that they can use when they get sick, to figure out which virus you had! Both survey and viral profiling data will be data you can share on your Open Humans profile.</p>
